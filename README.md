This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Run with the current `next-i18n-next` codebase:

```
yarn install-without-fix;
```

Run with the patched `next-i18n-next` codebase:

```
yarn install-with-fix;
```

Notice that the re-render does not happen and the behaviour is as expected when running with the patch.
